Reverse-Add program for Lychrel Numbers

The reverse-and-add process produces the sum of a number and the number formed by reversing the order of its digits. For example, 56 + 65 = 121. As another example, 125 + 521 = 646.
Some numbers become palindromes quickly after repeated reversal and addition, and are therefore not Lychrel numbers. All one-digit and two-digit numbers eventually become palindromes after repeated reversal and addition.

Program is named 196 because of the Lychrel number 196 and r/196
